<p>More efficient and effective control Return on investment cost savings. ICH Q8 defines QTPP as A prospective summary of the quality characteristics of a drug product that ideally will be achieved to ensure the desired quality taking into account safety and efficacy of the drug product. It is meant to ensure that the intended performance of a final drug product is as expected both in terms of purity and efficacy. With QbD you will get a proactive approach to product development potential to reduce FDA queries and review time and the scientific data to quickly get to the root cause and resolution of any deviation.</p>
