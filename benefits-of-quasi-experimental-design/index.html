<p>Quasi-experimental design is most useful in situations where it would be unethical or impractical to run a true experiment. Quasi-experimental research offers the benefit of comparison between groups. Quasi-experimental methods that involve the creation of a comparison group are most often used when it is not possible to randomize individuals or groups to treatment and control groups. Simply de ned the independent.</p>

<p>Allows researchers to enhance external validity. The intervention can be a training program a policy change or a medical treatment. Unlike a true experiment in a quasi-experimental study the choice of who gets the intervention and who doesnt is not randomized. Allows researchers to disregard internal validity. In medical informatics the quasi-experimental sometimes called the pre-post intervention design often is used to evaluate the benefits of specific interventions.</p>
