<p><strong>Block Design Definition</strong>, This is a common practice in agriculture animal science drug studies and. The total possible treatment arrangements can be calculated as. Eeach blockunit contains a complete set of treatments which are assigned randomly to the units. The Randomized Complete Block Design may be defined as the design in which the experimental material is divided into blocksgroups of homogeneous experimental units experimental units have same characteristics and each blockgroup contains a complete set of treatments which are assigned at random to the experimental units.</p>

<p>Block design is the classic method initially being the standard fMRI paradigm. An incidence system is a triple P B I where P and B are non-empty sets and I is a non-empty subset of P B. The block size is smaller than the total number of treatments to be compared in the incomplete block designs. In the statistical theory of the design of experiments blocking is the arranging of experimental units in groups blocks that are similar to one another.</p>
