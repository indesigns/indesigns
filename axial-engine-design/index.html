<p><strong>Axial Engine Design</strong>, The axial engine architecture allows us to implement our constant volume combustion cycle delivers extremely low vibration in a convenient quasi-cylindrical package and we have overcome the traditional limitations associated with the configuration. Axial flux motors were studied by British inventor and EV enthusiast Cedric Lynch as early as 1979. What are the Applications of Axial Flux Motor. Axial-flux motor designs also impact electromagnetics characteristics because magnetic flux travels shorter distances.</p>

<p>The axial design offers complete primary balance and negligible secondary vibration. This means for the same permanent magnet and copper winding provision you get more torque. To sum up the axial flux motor has the following advantages. According to Nevada-based Axial Vector Energy Corporation AVEC it has powerful lightweight and highly efficient radial-design engines capable of producing significantly higher horsepower and torque with considerably lower fuel requirements than is the case.</p>

<p>Ultimately we ended up with a double stator single rotor Axial Flux brushless motor. This aspect of axial-flux motor design typically deli vers a 30 torque density advantage over a conventional radial motor. This video features inventor Roy Pfieffer. Besides our motors stand out from other axial flux motors in exceptional high power torque density low weight and compact design.
