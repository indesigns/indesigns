<p><strong>Associational Research Design</strong>, A positive relationship between two variables is when an increase in one variable leads to a rise in the other variable. Linear model covariational statistics presume too much about how causes and effects are inter-related to rely on for adequately informing such research so SHP needs a less presumptive and more data sensitive form of study design and data analysis the associational model. Relational research is used when a researcher is interested in the extent to which changes in one variable is reflected in changes in the other. The appropriate selection of a study design is only one element in successful research.</p>
