<p>International competitive aerobatic flight requires a highly skilled and determined pilot combined with an aircraft capable of high maneuverability high thrust-to-weight and low mass moment of inertia. The obvious difference in an rc aerobatic plane is its design configuration notably the position of the wing in relation to the fuselage depth and the wing section. Compare this product Remove from comparison tool. Flat surfaces which are symmetrical sections work well for tail surfaces to a point but arent as good as a true airfoiled section.
