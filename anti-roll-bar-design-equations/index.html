<p>The anti-roll bar cantilever length measured from the centre line of the roll bar to where the canti-lever mounts to the drop link. The Anti-roll bar must be installed via a rubber bush 2 which restricts the degree of freedom and allows only rotation along the axis of the anti-roll bar. The anti-roll bar is an important element of the suspension since it allows the designer to control the roll stiffness of the vehicle independently from the bump stiffness. As a result the outer wheel moves up with respect to the chassis and the inner wheel will move down.</p>

<p>Later by iterating the length of the moment arm the torque tau applied on the shaft is iterated by using Eq. However due to the way that springs in series need to be added the following equation is used.

<p>If the car drives through a corner its body will roll to the outside of the bend. Assuming that the vehicle acts in pure roll the roll stiffness contribution by the anti-roll bar can be estimated using the bar dimensions and material properties.

<p>This helps in equal application of torque on both wheels. This helps in equal application of torque on both wheels. They can all be added together in series to calculate an overall stiffness for the anti-roll bar. Typically anti roll bars act as a supplement to the corner springs in generating roll resistance and account for around 20-40 of the total vehicle roll stiffness.

<p>Hello and welcome to SVA Designin this video i show you how i made the anti roll bar mechanisme for the single seater hypercar suspention that im designing i. Assuming that the vehicle acts in pure roll the roll stiffness contribution by the anti-roll bar can be estimated using the bar dimensions and material properties. Required area moment of inertia Required Roll stiffness X Length of tubeShear Modulus Area moment of inertia for cylindrical tube 4. The equation for the contribution of the anti-roll bar is.
