<p>This design is known as a double-leaf bascule bridge Figure 131-1. In addition to this the bridge provides a permanent 15m-wide and 3m-high navigable channel for smaller boats to pass underneath and thanks to a movable bascule north span a 25m wide channel. Each of these spans is approximately 35m long. The South Front Street Bridge is a Strauss trunnion bascule bridge.</p>

<p>Design is called a single-leaf bascule bridge. A bascule bridge is a type of drawbridge consisting of two counterweighted leaves or spans which pivot upward on a horizontal axis to allow boat traffic to pass underneath. When the leaves are in the lowered position they meet at the center of the channel.

<p>The design of the bascule bridge was such that it could open to a maximum of 27 degrees but for future scope researchers can design it in such a way that it opens for larger angles ffor or taller ships and barges to pass through them. Although the bascule had been in use in Europe for more than five centuries it was not until the 1890s that engineers successfully developed innovative designs that produced a balanced system making large bascule bridges easy to raise and lower.

<p>The counterweights help balance each side of the bridge during the upward swing which assists in the lifting motion. The design of the bascule bridge was such that it could open to a maximum of 27 degrees but for future scope researchers can design it in such a way that it opens for larger angles ffor or taller ships and barges to pass through them. When the leaves are in the lowered position they meet at the center of the channel. A bascule bridge rotates in a vertical plane up and down around a horizontal axis much like a seesaw.

<p>8th Street Bridge and 10th Street Bridge Manitowoc. This design is known as a double-leaf bascule bridge Figure 131-1. The South Front Street Bridge is a Strauss trunnion bascule bridge. A properly designed double leaf bascule bridge should be very rigid particularly in regard to primary live load deflections.
