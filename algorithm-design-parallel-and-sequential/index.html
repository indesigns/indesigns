<p>The taskchannel model encourages parallel algorithm designs that maximize local computations and minimize communications The algorithm designer typically partitions the computation identiï¬es communications among primitive tasks agglomerates primitive tasks into larger tasks and decides how to map tasks to processors. The emphasis is on teaching fundamental concepts applicable across a wide variety of problem domains and transferable across a reasonably broad set of programming languages and computer architectures. The asymptotic runtime of a sequential program is identical on any serial platform. The application consists of a set of processes with separate address spaces. The subject of this chapter is the design and analysis of parallel algorithms.</p>
