<p>The taskchannel model encourages parallel algorithm designs that maximize local computations and minimize communications The algorithm designer typically partitions the computation identiﬁes communications among primitive tasks agglomerates primitive tasks into larger tasks and decides how to map tasks to processors. The emphasis is on teaching fundamental concepts applicable across a wide variety of problem domains and transferable across a reasonably broad set of programming languages and computer architectures. The asymptotic runtime of a sequential program is identical on any serial platform. The application consists of a set of processes with separate address spaces. The subject of this chapter is the design and analysis of parallel algorithms.</p>
