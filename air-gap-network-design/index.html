<p>You can use advanced NIC teaming methods to create an air-gap storage fabric. An air gap demands creating a whole new network with standalone servers routers switches management tools etc. However a true air gap is no longer practical in an interconnected world. Basically it means a device or group of devices that have no network interfaces connected to other unsecure. An air gap like this assures that your backup data stays offline and hence inaccessible to any outside party making it unreachable attackers or hackers.</p>
