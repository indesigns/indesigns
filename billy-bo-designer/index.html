<p>In 1979 BillyBoy began to design and manufacture costume jewellery under the label Surreal Bijoux in Paris. Highlights from the house of Billy Bo range from the design of Olympic Airways uniforms in 1980 all the way to a high-brow collaboration with American department store giant Neiman Marcus also in. It was only when fashion designer Billy Bo Vasilis Kourkoumelis who catapulted to fame at a very young age opened his own boutique on 5th Avenue in Manhattan and was referred to in the Greek press as an Adonis or Apollo due to his beauty and Alexandros Iolas a world-renowned gallery owner and art collector who was friends with some of the towering figures in 20th. Bo could have done the same or sold the designs to Gretsch.
