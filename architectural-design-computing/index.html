Decisions about building form materials and systems can be tested and adjusted to impr ove performance. It involves developing computational procedures and models for the formulation of design requirements and rules algorithmic generation of designs analysis simulation and evaluation of building performance for design optimization of buildings. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system This framework is established by examining the software requirements document and designing a model for providing implementation details.</p>
