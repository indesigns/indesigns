<p><strong>Biofloc System Design Pdf</strong>, The basic system of bio-floc technology was given by Avnimelech 2000 2005ab. Maximum biofloc systems in commercial use are greenwater. A person having small landholding as small as 150-200 square metres of land and having either municipal piped water supply or bore well water supply can establish this business with a small investment. The biofloc-based farming system is a new technology for the promotion of intensive fish shrimp production in a limited area.</p>
