<p>Vi GDA Decision Document for the AP1000 reactor 5 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC Westinghouse submitted its AP1000 nuclear power plant design for generic design assessment in August 2007. The AP1000 Plant is a two-loop pressurized water reactor PWR that uses a simplified innovative and effective approach to safety. With a gross power rating of 3415 megawatt thermal MWt and a nominal net electrical output of 1110 megawatt electric MWe the AP1000 Plant with a 157-fuel-assembly core is ideal for new baseload generation. The first milestone deals with the NRCs review of the design itself to see if it can be approved or certified for US. ML11171A322 - Westinghouse AP1000 Design Control Document Rev.</p>
