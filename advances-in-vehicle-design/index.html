<p>Recent work is described that extends design synthesis and optimisation to cover a far wider range of air-vehicle concepts and links concept design optimisation to multi-disciplinary analysis and optimisation. Synthesis Lectures on Advances in Auto-motive Technology Series is intended to introduce such new transformational technologies in the automotive industry to its readers. Significant effort has been dedicated to exploring strategies to improve the design of CARs themselves or integrate their activity with other regulatory circuits to enable more precise function. In part 1 of this 2 part virtual summit we covered some of the key advances in electric vehicle design and development using simulation solutions. We aim to make it one of the premier comprehensive academic publications of the world aerospace community.</p>
