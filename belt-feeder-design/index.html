<p>To solve a conveyor problem certain facts must first be known. The book provides interesting and useful information about the pressure calculation from hopper however the presented information is in context of belt feeder. Serving the weigh feeding industry since 1908 MERRICK has a tremendous working knowledge with belt feeders for every application imaginable and we are committed to helping design the feeder that will offer the level of reliable performance accuracy and repeatability your application requires. This information is essential for sound conveyor engineering.</p>

<p>In other cases transfer chutes are employed to direct the flow of bulk material from one conveyor belt to another often via a three dimensional path. Gravimetric feeders should be used whenever there is a requirement for close control of material discharge. Belt feeders are commonly used when material that is either stockpiled or loaded at an uncontrolled rate in a bin or hopper needs to be introduced into the system at a controlled feed rate. BHT Belt Feeders are designed and manufactured to ensure long life and reliable service in the harshest of operating environments. However belt feeders of higher capacities are also possible.</p>
