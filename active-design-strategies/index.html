<p>Passive design responds to local climate and site conditions to maximise building users comfort and health while minimising energy use. Sustainable building and passive design key features passive design in new and existing buildings. The phrase emerged out the Active Design Guidelines which was a manual originally published by the City of New York in 2010 to guide the creation of health-promoting buildings streets and urban spaces based on the latest academic research and best practices. 7 Avoid creation of Static DNS Records as much as possible.
