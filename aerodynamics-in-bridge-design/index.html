<p>Even in regions prone to strong earthquakes has this been found to be the case. It contains the background. Design experience from recent long-span cable-supported bridges shows that aerodynamic action can be the determining factor for stiffness requirements on the bridge deck. Subtle changes to the cross section of the bridge have a big effect on how stable the bridge is in strong winds.</p>

<p>But nowadays some large vessels have so much superstructure above the water that they have to be designed carefully too or the ship could rock badly in high winds or even become unstable. The aerodynamic aspects of bridge design shall be carried out in accordance with the rules including associated annexes when applicable. But nowadays some large vessels have so much superstructure above the water that they have to be designed carefully too or the ship could rock badly in high winds or even become unstable. Steel works great for earthquake resistant designs but from an aerodynamic point of view the bridge towers become very light and flexible. The weight torsional stiffness and especially the shape of the cross section of a suspension bridge deck determine the stability of the bridge in strong winds.</p>
