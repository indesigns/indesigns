<p><strong>Biomimicry Design Inspired By Nature</strong>, Biomimicry or bio-inspired design means taking inspiration from nature and turning it into something that we can use in a technical application. This does not imply that it would be easy to translate natural knowledge into viable technology and products. Nature is used in many specialized areas and many words are using to define it in each area. Their new surface is essentially omniphobic is composed of low cost materials and self heals.</p>

<p>Biomimicry or bio-inspired design means taking inspiration from nature and turning it into something that we can use in a technical application. Leading science writer biologist and co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute Janine Benyus enthuses in her 2009 Ted Talk that biomimicry is innovation inspired by nature Her poignant address points to the concept of looking to mother nature to solve overcome and most importantly innovate when it comes to man-made designs. Nature is used in many specialized areas and many words are using to define it in each area. Innovation Inspired by Nature Janine Benyus who coined the term biomimicry back in 1997 believes that designers have a lot to learn from the natural world.</p>

Biomimicry learns from and mimics the strategies found in nature to solve human design challenges. Leading science writer biologist and co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute Janine Benyus enthuses in her 2009 Ted Talk that biomimicry is innovation inspired by nature Her poignant address points to the concept of looking to mother nature to solve overcome and most importantly innovate when it comes to man-made designs.
