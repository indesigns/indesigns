<p><strong>Basics Of Pressure Vessel Design</strong>, A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially different from the ambient pressure. The forces that influence pressure vessel design are internalexternal pressure. Pressure vessels are prone to explosion while in operation due to possible errors in material selection design and other engineering activities. Addressing issues at hand for a working professional this book covers material selection testing and design of pressure vessels which enables users to effectively use code rules and available design softwares.</p>
