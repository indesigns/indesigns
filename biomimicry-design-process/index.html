<p>A Unique Art of Mimicking. From a problem to biology and from biology to an application. Biomimicry in architecture and manufacturing is the practice of designing buildings and products that simulate or co-opt processes that occur in nature. Now that you have a sense for what a biomimetic approach looks like lets consider how some of the concepts and tools of biomimicry can be integrated into other design frameworks by looking at two that are widely used in design and engineering.

<p>Without this relevant knowledge it may be difficult for any designer to create a viable solution adapted from nature. The terms biomimicry and biomimetics come from the Greek words bios meaning life and mimesis meaning to imitate.

<p>It is not only in the design process where biomimicry can be employed. A detailed understanding of biology is often needed for biomimicry research and design. This Thesis will focus on a deep exploration of how Biomimicry has been used in the past and how it can be used to generate a sustainable response to an architectural design.
