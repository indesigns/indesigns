<p>Features of the intake system 3410 The intake manifold is just a series of cylinders that distributes air evenly to each of the engine cylinders which enables right amount of air to mix with right amount of fuel. The purpose of a duct system is to transmit air from the central air source to the air diffusers located in the building control zones. I have to design 2 plenum boxes 1 for Fresh Air Supply Fans and 1 for Exhaust Air Fans. A plenum chamber is a pressurised housing containing a fluid typically air at positive pressureOne of its functions is to equalise pressure for more even distribution compensating for irregular supply or demand.</p>

<p>Along with your Manual J calculations you will get a duct schematic which will show all components of the duct system and the size holes to cut down through the floor for the supplies and returnsThis step cannot. The air has mass inertia and as piston draws a vacuum on the valve end of the plenum runner the air starts to accelerate towards and through the valve somewhere steady state is reached. It is also used to balnce the air and attenuate the sound caused by air movement in the duct. Homes are typically heated or cooled using an air conditioning and heating system.
