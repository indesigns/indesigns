<p>Conventional Bottom Ash Dewatering System. Ash handling equipment is one of the most crucial links in the solid fuel biomass boiler and combustion systems chain. Fly ash handling systems include fly ash slurry transportation with bottom ash and fly ash dry pneumatic transportation. Fly ash is collected using electrostatic precipitators ESPs that operate by charging the particulate matter entrained in the flue gas stream through high voltage and then electrostatically influencing those particles to oppositely charged electrodes.
