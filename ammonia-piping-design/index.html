Using DX ammonia can reduce the evaporator charge by as much as 30 to 50 times compared to bottom feed flooded or pumped designs. We work with Wisconsin restaurants grocery stores factories and other prominent businesses to handle every aspect of their system design. Boiling Fluids - Max Suction Flow Velocity - Recommended max suction flow velocity when pumping boiling fluids.

<p>Only steel or ductile iron should be used for ammonia containers valves fittings and piping. Velocities in horizontal lines should be at least 750 ftmin. To improve the safety of ammonia refrigeration piping and system components the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration IIAR has a guideline for labeling them. This information is presented to illustrate the general system features particular to a successful DX Ammonia design. Pin On Products.</p>
