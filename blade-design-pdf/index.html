<p>They are well suited for low tip speed and high-airflow work - they are best suited for moving large volumes of air against relatively low pressures. INTRODUCTION A turbine blade is the individual component which makes up the turbine section of a gas turbine or steam turbine. The design of the blade is done by using autocad and Solidworks 2018. The scope is to ﬁnd the balance between the design process to obtain the optimum overall performance of the blades by varying the main aerodynamic parameters chord twist span-wise locations of airfoils and the.
