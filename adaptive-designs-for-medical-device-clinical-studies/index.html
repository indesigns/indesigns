In particular we resize the study and adjust the critical value for hypothesis testing simultaneously after an interim analysis to achieve a target power and control the type I error rate in comparing AUCs of two modalities. An adaptive design for a medical device clinical study is defined as a clinical trial design that allows for prospectively planned modifications based on accumulating study data without undermining the trials integrity and validity. Statistical analysis plans are needed for both interim and final analyses.</p>
