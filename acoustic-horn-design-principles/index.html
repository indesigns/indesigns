<p>This room modal behavior is the worst one possible having two first modes coinciding with each other and their third mode coinciding with the second vertical mode at about 120Hz. Stage walls and ceiling can have limited controlled acoustic reflection to enhance the performance. In a horn the acoustical impedance will increase when the cross-section of the horn decreases as a decrease in cross sec-tion will limit the flow of air at a certain pressure. Design principlesThe theory of acoustic horns is based on the problem of longitudinal vibrations of multi-element rods that have cylindrical elements and elements of variable cross-sections.</p>
