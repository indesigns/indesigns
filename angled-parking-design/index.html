<p><strong>Angled Parking Design</strong>, Unfortunately straight parking spaces do take up more square footage. The width of an aisle is usually 12 to 26 feet depending on the angle at which the parking stalls are oriented. Diagonal parking especially at a curb-side is very dangerous. They are marked so that each vehicle fits into the designed marked area.</p>

<p>Angled parking spaces feature spots tilting at two angles 60 degrees and 45 degrees. In tight places the forty-five degree 45 stall is sometimes preferred. Due to vehicle tracking curves or the required space for manoeuvring in and out of angled spaces the angle of the space affects both the required aisle width and the width and depth of the individual. The shallower the angle the narrower the minimum aisle width and overall parking area width is required however wider space is needed for adjacent spaces and therefore fewer cars can fit in a row.
