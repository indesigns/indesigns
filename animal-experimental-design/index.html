<p>Reduction in animal use can be achieved by better experimental strategy and improved experimental design. In our study we evaluated the methodological quality of animal research in critical care journals in 2005 and 2015 and found a significant increase in the reporting of power analyses. Initial Steps Literature Search A thorough search of the scientific literature must be per-formed to determine what is known about the focus of the study.
