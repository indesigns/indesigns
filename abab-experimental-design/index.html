<p>Ethical and reversal issues exeducation cant be taken away. ABAB Design An ABAB design is similar to an ABA design except after the post-treatment measurement period the intervention is re-introduced B with the assumption that the treatment effect will return. Single-subject research is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis with both human and non-human participants. It is widely used and has been shown to be effective for improving specific skills and decreasing problem behaviors. The percentage of time he spent studying the dependent variable was low during the first baseline phase increased during the first treatment phase until it leveled off decreased during the second baseline phase and again increased during the second treatment phase.</p>

<p>ABAB Design An ABAB design is similar to an ABA design except after the post-treatment measurement period the intervention is re-introduced B with the assumption that the treatment effect will return. In an ABAB Reversal design an experimenter rotates two or more conditions and has a participant complete several consecutive sessions in each condition. Combining two or more single-case designs such as ABAB and multiple baseline stems from a need to obtain answers to more complex research questions Changing criterion design A criterion for reinforcement is changed across the experiment to demonstrate a functional relation between reinforcement and behavior.
