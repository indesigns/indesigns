The Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering SAMPE Diamond Bar Calif US has extended abstract deadlines for the SAMPE 2022 Conference Exhibition until Nov. The cost advantage of AFP is reduced manufacturing labour reduced need for in-process inspection and a significant reduction in process material scrap. However the cost advantage does vary with the application being generally more substantial for large components such as fuselage structure that allow the machine to run at top speed than for smaller more complex parts that require slow.
