<p>There are many safety features in the design and fabrication of an air separation plant including hydrocarbon detection and control oxygen cleanliness oxygen velocity control and choice of materials of construction. Air Products has more than 75 years of experience designing engineering constructing and operating air separation units ASU for customers requiring large amounts of oxygen nitrogen or argon. Air separation plant design DJ. Plant Design of Cryogenic distillation of Air to Oxygen and Nitrogen Project By. Most of the problem components in the air separation process boil at temperatures above oxygen and hence will tend to concentrate in the oxygen product unless otherwise removed.</p>
