<p><strong>Aqueduct Design</strong>, There were three main aqueduct designs including tunnels siphons and bridges as shown in Figure A as well as cisterns to store the water. In addition to the above considerations the following criteria should be adopted while designing the siphon aqueducts. In modern engineering however aqueduct refers to a system of pipes ditches canals tunnels and supporting structures used to convey water from its source to its main distribution point. Across valleys and low land.</p>

<p>Aqueducts were amazing feats of engineering given the time period. The various types of structures that are built to carry the canal water across the above mentioned obstructions are called cross drainage works.
