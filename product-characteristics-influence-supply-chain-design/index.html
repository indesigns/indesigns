<p>A product might be attractive for customers but drive unnecessary supply chain costs because of the impact the product design has on sourcing packaging production warehousing and transportation. Higher complexity in product demand and design characteristics increases complexity in supply chain coordination and configuration while reducing complexity in supply chain collaboration. Since product design is directly associated with supply chain risk Khan et al 2008. Based on the findings a taxonomy is proposed to provide a reference frame for practitioners to formulate appropriate alignment strategies to manage or mitigate risk associated with growing supply chain complexity.</p>

<p>These authors show that decisions on product design have a major impact on supply chain design and vice-versa. A product might be attractive for customers but drive unnecessary supply chain costs because of the impact the product design has on sourcing packaging production warehousing and transportation. The first characteristic of an effective supply chain is the consistency of leadership. Learn process improvements such as postponement mass customization resequencing production operations and shifting the push-pull point. Higher complexity in product demand and design characteristics increases complexity in supply chain coordination and configuration while reducing complexity in supply chain collaboration.</p>
