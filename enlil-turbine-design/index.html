<p><strong>Enlil Turbine Design</strong>, Each turbine follows a simple design. The principal objective of this project is design modelling and simulation of a Darrieus rotor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. The turbines generate energy from vehicles that pass at a velocity that creates wind turbulence. The turbine includes multiple vertically extending stator vanes circumferentially spaced apart about the rotor in an annular array.</p>
