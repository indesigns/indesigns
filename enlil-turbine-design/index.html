<p><strong>Enlil Turbine Design</strong>, Each turbine follows a simple design. The principal objective of this project is design modelling and simulation of a Darrieus rotor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. The turbines generate energy from vehicles that pass at a velocity that creates wind turbulence. The turbine includes multiple vertically extending stator vanes circumferentially spaced apart about the rotor in an annular array.</p>

<p>The electrical output of vertical axis turbine and the solar system is stored in a battery. The vertical design allows engineers to place the turbines closer together. The proximity of horizontal wind turbines to one another can create turbulence and reductions in wind speed that affects the output of neighboring units. A Turkish company Devecitech has constucted their Enlil Wind turbine that harnesses the breeze produced by moving vehicles and converts it into electric energy.</p>
