<p>It is needed to processing FPGA. ABSTRACT -The project aims at designing a 16 bit synchronous microprocessor using vhdl and the implementation of its components in FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array. So for every VHDL file there should be atleast one entity and for entity there must be atleast one architecture. Describing and designing complex electronic systems has become an overwhelming activit for which VHDL is showing increasingly useful and promising support.
