<p>ProAdvices are short and simplified excerpts from Professor Gudmundssons design handbook Aircraft Preliminary Design Handbook and are intended to provide the aircraft designer with clear and concise analysis methods for the aircraft designer. The aim is two-fold. This text has been assembled to aid technical students in bridging the gap between the point a where they have a fairly complete knowledge of the fundamentals of mathematics mechanics and machine design and b the point where they are sufficiently familiar with the application of these fundamentals to the design of aircraft engines to enable them to be of value to the aircraft - engine. From weight and performance sizing to aerodynamics and stability and control analysis you can monitor all aspects of the design every step of the way.
