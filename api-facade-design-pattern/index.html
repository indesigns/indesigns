<p>In this section we will discuss the Facade Pattern. In simple words we can say that the Facade Design Pattern is used to hide the complexities of a system and provides an easy-to-use interface to the client using which the client can access the system. Thats because facades are a kludge. A Facade Pattern says that just just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client. Like a facade an API gateway encapsulates the applications internal architecture and provides an API to its clients.</p>
