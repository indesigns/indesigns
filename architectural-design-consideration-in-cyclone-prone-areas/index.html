<p>In Queensland architects landscape architects and urban designers are currently on the frontline in providing innovative design solutions for residents of flood-prone areas. In contrast to designing for gravity loads the lighter the building the larger or heavier the foundation needs to be in cyclone resistant design. Ignoring this precept has led to some dramatic failure of long-span steel-framed warehouses. Cities or towns with a history of cyclone are classified as cyclone prone areas. Lighter roof would not induce as much load on the walls and the walls would be able to transfer the loads easily during an earthquake.</p>
