<p><strong>Blended Wing Design</strong>, As the old adage goes. In this concept wide airfoil-shaped body is smoothly blended with high lift wings which means that the entire aircraft contributes to the generation of lift thereby. A Conceptual Design and Analysis Tool for Blended Wing Body Aircraft to arrive at a feasible aircraft design at the end of the conceptual design phase. This provides a means of designing planes requiring tightly coupled technologies.</p>

<p>The benefits of the blended wing design are traditionally tied to efficiency from weight loss. Ok so the blended wing body BWB passenger airplane is coming back again thanks to Airbus. Blended Wing Body BWB configuration is an unconventional aircraft design in which the wing and fuselage are blended to form an aircraft. An airplane that can generate as much lift without wings can carry more cargo.</p>

<p>The Blended Wing Body BWB aircraft is a non-conventional design in which the fuselage and the wings are combined into one fluid shape instead of three distinct parts assembled. The radical Blended Wing design has been developed by Boeing in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center. This paper describes the use of an MDO framework to design a distributed propulsion Blended-Wing-Body BWB aircraft 4. It promises fuel efficiency more passengers and so on and so forth.
