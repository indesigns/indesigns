<p><strong>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Analytical Research Design</strong>, Advantages and disadvantages of descriptive research. A research design is important in that it enables the assessment to be result-full as possible thereby producing enough information. However this type of study is limited in its ability to draw valid conclusions about any association or possible causality because the presence of risk factors and outcomes are measured simultaneously. It provides suitable reason.</p>

<p>It does not consider any facts or findingsOn the other hand an analytical research answers questions why how when and by whom the incident happened. Advantages Useful for hypothesis generation Informative for very rare disease with few established risk factors Characterizes averages for disorder Disadvantages Cannot study cause and effect relationships Cannot assess disease frequency Case series. A research design is important in that it enables the assessment to be result-full as possible thereby producing enough information. A research design functions as a bridge between what has been established the research objectives what is actually to be performed in the conduct of the study to achieve those objectives. As well as controlling the independent variable the experimenter attempts to eliminate unwanted extraneous variables Control over extraneous variables is usually greater than in other research methods.</p>
