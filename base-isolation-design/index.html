<p>After an event of earthquake the repair of structure and loss of non-structural components may be a more costly affair than installing base. The first base-isolated building with over 60 m height in Japan and Thousand Tower was the tallest base-isolated residential Tower in Japan when completed. Base isolation has become a major feature of structural design in the past few decades. Anti seismic designs is base isolation which may not reduce the ground movement but would help in keeping the impact of ground movement to its minimal extend.</p>
