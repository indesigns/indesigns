<p><strong>Aerated Static Pile Composting Design</strong>, Aerated Static pile - usually placed on perforated piping providing air circulation for controlled aeration. The static compost pile can be constructed according to the permeability of the raw materials the weather conditions and the performance of the equipment used. Static Piles - slower process air supply how to avoid going anaerobic. All aeration components in contact with the composts corrosive exhaust air-stream are made from stainless steel or polymeric materials.</p>

<p>Aerated Static Pile - ASP Systems Design. The key design criteria of a forced aeration system include the rate of airflow cfmcy of compost the uniformity of airflow through the whole pile and the ability to intelligently adjust the airflow to control temperatures early in the process. Evenly shaped windrows have fewer dry spots and process more evenly. Aerated Static pile - usually placed on perforated piping providing air circulation for controlled aeration.</p>

<p>Aeration is accomplished by either blowing air into the pile or drawing air down through the pile through the perforated pipes. Place perforated pipes on the ground that are connected to a blower to push positive or pull negative air through the compost. Known as aerated static pile composting this may be an option to consider if you are dealing with a large volume of manure more than four horses as it eliminates manual turning. Designing an Aerated Static Pile ASP composting system can range from simple to complicated for a look at the basic parts involved in an ASP. Temperature probes were randomly introduced into a freshly built aerated static pile.</p>

<p>Aerated Static Pile or ASP systems have been the standard for providing aeration to active compost piles for over 40 years. This simply means that we induce airflow through the mix of materials using an electric blower - we do not turn the pile during the active phase first 30 days of composting. Another method is to manually turn windrows elongated piles using a shovel or front-end loader to tumble the manure to introduce oxygen throughout the mix.
