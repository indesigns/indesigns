<p>The significant difference between ASIC and FPGA design flow is that the design flow for ASICs is a far more complex and rigorous design-intensive process. Its now possible to achieve the best of both worlds with FPGA to ASIC conversion. Even though an FPGA is a type of gate array we do not consider the term gate-array based ASICs to include FPGAs. Field-Programmable Gate ArraysFPGAs FPGAs are the newest member of the ASIC family and are rapidly growing in replacing TTL in microelectronic systems.</p>
