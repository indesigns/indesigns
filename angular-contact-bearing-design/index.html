<p>One-directional thrust bearings can support heavy thrust loads in one direction combined with moderate radial loads. 2 The bearings must be adjusted against each other until the requisite clearance or preload is obtained Selecting preload. Angular contact ball bearings have inner and outer ring raceways that are displaced relative to each other in the direction of the bearing axis. As you have seen in the constructional feature of the Angular contact bearing the line of contact of the rolling element or the ball is angular. Barden angular contact bearings have a nominal contact angle ranging from 10 to 25.</p>

<p>Angular Contact Bearing Design Angular contact bearings have one ring shoulder removed this may be from the inner or outer ring. In angular contact ball bearings the line of action of the load at the contacts between balls and raceways forms an angle with the bearings axis. These bearings have a contact angle so that they can sustain significant axial loads in one direction together with radial loads. They can accommodate radial loads as well as axial loads in both directions. Pin On Cscbearings Com.</p>

<p>Angular contact ball bearings are suitable for applications which require high accuracy and good high-speed performance. Shaft and housing tolerances The recommended shaft tolerances for radial bearings with a cylindrical bore must be observed see table. Angular contact ball bearings are available from Timken in single- row 7200 and 7300 series and double-row 3200 and 3300 series. The structure of double row angular contact ball bearings is designed by arranging two single row angular contact bearings back-to-back in duplex DB to form a single bearing with a contact angle of 25.
