<p><strong>Alternative Internal Combustion Engine Designs</strong>, Due to their periodic diet these machines are particularly suitable for changes where the temperature reaches high values. The high octane number of ethanol allows the use of ethanol as fuel in an SI engine with a higher compression ratio 40. The Grail engine is a two-stroke design that consists of a single exhaust valve three spark plugs and a direct fuel injector all located at the top of the cylinder. After my post explaining how internal combustion engines work a number of friends were quick to point out that I hadnt discussed some popular variants of the standard ICE design.</p>

<p>It is at least in theory a more power-dense and more efficient alternative to piston in cylinder engines. The internal combustion engine has been impacting on our lives for. It allows for more rapid compressionexpansion of the chamber a hyper-expansive two-stroke cycle a better shaped combustion chamber and the pre-compression of the incoming charge of air all of. The octane number of ethanol is higher than the octane number of the gasoline.</p>
