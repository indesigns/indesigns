<p>-300F to 450F -184C to 232C O-Ring dependent. Combination of SPE and DPE A trunnion mounted ball valve with the upstream seat unidirectional and the downstream seat bi-directional blocks the fluid at the downstream seat in both directions while it blocks the fluid on the upstream seat in one direction only. The ball is free to rotate resulting in even wear and a wiping action between the ball and seat. In the closed position ball is pushed against the seat by the pressure of the fluid from upstream and hence can pressure seal the downstream of. Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings.</p>

<p>-300F to 450F -184C to 232C O-Ring dependent. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service. The metal-seated ball valve design has enabled ball valves to take a big chunk out of the market share dominated for decades by the venerable gate valve. In an HPLC device a pair of check valve inlet outlet prevent the flow from a high-pressure area into the low-pressure area because of which there is a continuous flow through the column at high pressure.

<p>A floating design ball valve sandwiches the hollow ball between two or more cupped seats that form a tight seal between the body and the ball at the inlet and outlet ports of the valve body. A double-disc or wafer check valve consists of two half-circle disks hinged together. Ball Check Valves are simple and compact and commonly used on small water or wastewater pumps where economy is important. The ball valve uses a ball with a round through hole as the opening and closing part. Pin On Ball Valve Supplier Cast Iron Din Ball Valve Ansi Ball Valve 10k Ball Valve.</p>
