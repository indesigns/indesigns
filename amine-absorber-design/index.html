<p>Global absorption Process by Amines The design of the absorber depends on the gas volume inlet concentration outlet specification pressure temperature liquid circulation rate solubility of the gas in liquid number of trays height contact time diameter of column and the presence of other components in the gas. Therefore it is necessary to properly allow reasonable first. For preliminary design a tray spacing of 24 in and a minimum diameter of capable of separating 150 to 200 micron droplets can be assumed. From the absorber the rich amine is directed to the top of a stripping tower where a drop in pressure and application of heat enables the solvent to be stripped of the. Depending on which one of the following four amines the unit was designed to use and what gases it was designed to remove these are some typical amine concentrations expressed as weight percent of pure amine in the aqueous.</p>
