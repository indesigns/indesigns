<p>It is often easier and less expensive to remove nitrogen from wastewater in the form of ammonia than to convert it to. The air is then passed directly to a thermal oxidiser where it is combusted destroying the ammonia and releasing nitrogen carbon dioxide and water to the atmosphere see Figure 2. This study reports an ammonia removal by an air stripping tower which is filled up with packing bed Intalox Saddles. The stripping column was designed to meet the specifications set in the design conditions while also being as cost-effective as possible.

<p>The ammonia stripping process is based on the principle of mass transfer. Hydraulic wastewater loading 01 to 02 lminm3 or 1 to 2 galminft2. Many studies have recommended an air-to-water flow ratio of 30001 to remove ammonium ions The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the stripping process for ammonium ion removal with air to water ratios of less than 30001The results of this study show that the air-to-water flow ratio is as low as 60.
