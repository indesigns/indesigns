<p>The inside walls of the duct are lined with 15. Active noise cancellation uses carefully located microphones signal digitization and sophisticated adaptive algorithms to create inverted signals to cancel out offending audio-band noise while leaving the desired sound unchanged resulting in a quiet background and better listening or resting experience. This technique has been practically used in air conditioning systems in large-scale buildings aircraft cabins and so on 1.

<p>II NOISE CANCELLATION USING ADAPTIVE FILTER The Single channel adaptive feedback Active Noise Cancellation ANC system works by processing the acoustical noise the target noise that would like to reduce by producing an anti-noise which cancels out the noise component by the method of adaptive filtering. Active noise cancellation ANC is to attenuate noise by the same sound but opposite phase. It then emits a mirror anti-noise signal through the audio systems speakers which effectively cancels those booming sounds and creates a quieter passenger compartment.

<p>Multiple types of ANC are currently being developed from simple Engine Order Cancellation to more advanced BroadbandRoad Noise Cancellation. However it should be noted that while this disables the active noise cancellation the bulkhead symposer will still amplify all the noises coming from the rear of the car so road and tire noise might be more noticeable than ever. Active noise cancellation uses carefully located microphones signal digitization and sophisticated adaptive algorithms to create inverted signals to cancel out offending audio-band noise while leaving the desired sound unchanged resulting in a quiet background and better listening or resting experience.
