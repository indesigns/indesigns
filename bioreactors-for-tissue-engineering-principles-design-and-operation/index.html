<p>Bioreactors are essential in tissue engineering not only because they provide an in vitro environment mimicking in vivo conditions for the growth of tissue substitutes but also because they enable systematic studies of the responses of living tissues to various mechanical and biochemical cues. For the first time in a single volume the design characterisation and operation of the bioreactor system in which the tissue is grown is detailed. Bioreactor design process scale-up and optimization. Chaudhuri J Al-Rubeai editors.
