<p>The experts in designing laboratories and the associated systems. The design team for retrofitting existing laboratory space is usually smaller and less formal but is still comprised a number of people with specialized skills including the builder electrician mechanic plumber and the laboratory manager or director. A construction project is organized as five successive stages. Most laboratory facilities built or designed since the mid-1990s in the US.</p>
