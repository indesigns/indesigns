<p>It is important for a country like India with a burgeoning urban population to adopt strict measures for constructing earthquake proof buildings. They include the floors and the roofs. Like damping these features are tuned to match and counteract the buildings frequency in the event of an earthquake. One of the prominent features of earthquake-proof buildings is that they have lighter roofs.</p>

<p>How to Build an Earthquake Proof House. Air Danshins shake test dealt only with side-to-side motion and most earthquakes are not limited to a two-dimensional plane. If your home is built out of wood you will need to ensure that it is bolted down at the foundations because if it is not the force from an earthquake can cause it to move. The objective of this document is to provide rural households with clear guidance regarding earthquake resistant construction techniques and to support them to have house designs in compliance with the National Building Code of Nepal.
