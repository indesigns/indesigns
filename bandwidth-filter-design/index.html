<p><strong>Bandwidth Filter Design</strong>, The quality factor Q is an equivalent design parameter to the filter order n. We will make a filter which allows the signals which have frequencies in the range of 80 Hz to 800 Hz. Many filters the bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the response has dropped by 3dB. It is typically measured in hertz and depending on context may specifically refer to passband bandwidth or baseband bandwidth.</p>

<p>Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous band of frequencies. Even though if we add a low pass filter first and then the high pass filter it will never make changes in the output signal. Many filters the bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the response has dropped by 3dB. Filter design requires compromises and the designer may not have complete control over the choice of parameters.
