Before-and-After Studies A quasi-experimental design that surveys exposures and disease status before and after an intervention time Intervention starts here Time period before Time period after A before and after study measures exposures and disease issues at two time points. Each study design has their own inherent strengths and weaknesses and there can be a general hierarchy in study designs however any hierarchy cannot be applied uniformly across study design types 3569. This second control group is not pre- measured but is exposed to the experimental variable and subjected of course to after measurement.
