<p>The air receiver is a type of pressure equipment that may require design and item registration under the Work Health and Safety Regulations. Most smaller air receivers are made with a platform on top for the compressor and motor to mount on. I think Akendewa does not required ASME U stamp for his air receiver but need to stamp the design construction code on this vessel for infomation only. Air receiver tanks are sized in gallons and range from small 5- and 10-gallon tanks to massive tanks that hold thousands of gallons of air. There are in principal two different air receivers in a compressed air system.</p>

<p>Today most compressed-air-system consultants compressor manufacturers and design engineers have put aside the myth of using piping for storage. An air receiver is used to store high-pressure air from the compressor. Each air receiver should be equipped with a pressure relief valve which is designed to release pressure from the tank in case the tank reaches its maximum allowable pressure inside the vessel.

<p>An air receiver attached to your air compressor installation helps to decrease loading and unloading cycles on the compressor itself easing its overall workload. The rules for the design and construction of air receivers are therefore very stringent and Hanson air receivers are built and tested strictly to the ASME pressure vessel code. Air coming from the compressor will be warm if not actually hot and the large surface area of the receiver dissipates this heat to the surrounding atmosphere. GFSA designs manufactures and tests air receiver tanks to meet BS EN 12285-12005 and BS EN 1993-4-2. Basic Set Up For Shop Air System Compressor Garage Workshop Workshop Organization.</p>
