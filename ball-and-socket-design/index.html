<p>A ball and socket joint is the connection of two bones one shaped like a ball and the other shaped like a larger open half sphere called a socket. The smooth joint with a hemispherical head that fits within a cuplike depression is called the ball and socket joint. This is the most freely moving joint. The MatOrtho medial ball-and-socket knee design consistently achieves superior functional performance and excellent survivorship.</p>
