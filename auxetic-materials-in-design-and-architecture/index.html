<p>The Shimizu TRY 2004 Mega-City Pyramid concept for Tokyo is a proposal so large that it can only be completed with the help of carbon nanotubes. Auxetic materials are characterized by the uncommon capacity of extending sideways when pulled longitudinally while contracting laterally under compressive action. So in terms of natural materials we can look at naturally-occurring crystalline silicates. Abstract As typical mechanical metamaterials with negative Poissons ratios auxetic metamaterials exhibit counterintuitive auxetic behaviors that are highly dependent on their geometric arrangements.
