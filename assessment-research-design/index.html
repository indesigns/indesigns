<p>A Correlation Design consists of a relationship between two or more variables and the relationship doesnt really imply cause and effect so when one variable changes the other changes as well. For instance a single-case A 1 B 1 A 2 B 2 withdrawal design aimed to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation using visuo-spatio-motor cueing for two participants with severe unilateral neglect after a severe right-hemisphere stroke. In the first weeks of the semester students are asked to locate and read journal articles on topics relevant to the unit and to use these to prepare a research brief suitable for. It constitutes the blueprint for the collection measurement and analysis of data.

Assessment refers to the collection of data to describe or better understand an issueresearch refers to the use of data for the purpose of describing predicting and controlling as a means toward better understanding the phenomena under consideration and evaluation refers to the comparison of data to a standard for the purpose of judging worth or quality. The research assessment tools describe the information that should be available in study reports and the key features of a high quality study design.
