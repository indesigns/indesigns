<p>The Lion class are the most restrained of the super battleships that never were. Many concepts of their design were incorporated in the Nelson Class Battleships. They were never ordered due to signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 which limited the size and armament of battleships to 35000 long tons 36000 t and no gun bigger than 16 inches 406 mm.
