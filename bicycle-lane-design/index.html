<p><strong>Bicycle Lane Design</strong>, What is a bikeway. 12 Six design principles There are five internationally-recognised design principles that cycling-friendly infrastructure needs. Bicycle lane designs have been evolving rapidly in recent years in response to increased participation rates and the realisation that there needs to be increased emphasis on improving the safety and experience of on-road bike riding for cyclists of all capabilities to better meet. Absolute minimum bike lane width is 4 ft 12 m when no curb and gutter is present or 5 ft 1.</p>
