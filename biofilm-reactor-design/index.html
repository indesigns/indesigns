<p>In order to overcome these operational problems the compact and innovative moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR was designed. In order to overcome these operational problems the compact and innovative moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR was designed. This suggests that surface-active molecules involved in biofilm formation have a real interest for the design of single-species biofilm reactors. This is appropriate because each reactor promotes the development of a specialized biofilm. The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design.</p>

<p>Moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR is a type of wastewater treatment process that was first invented by Prof. Moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR is a type of wastewater treatment process that was first invented by Prof. The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design. Process design with MBBR is based on the concept that treatment is achieved with several reactors in series and that each individual reactor is designated for a specific treatment function within the greater treatment scheme.

<p>The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design. The moving bed biofilm reactor MBBR can operate as a 2- anoxic or 3- aerobic phase system with buoyant free-moving plastic biofilm carriers. Reactor and process design considerations for these reactors are reviewed. This is appropriate because each reactor promotes the development of a specialized biofilm.
