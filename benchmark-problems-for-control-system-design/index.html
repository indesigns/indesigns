<p>We have tried to include the basic information about each of the problems the simulation input file eg EPANET files for water distribution systems and any other information we found useful in analyzing these problems. This is the web page for the new book in control theory. Allows the use of graphical methods to predict system performance without solving the differential equations of the system. Management control system is designed to cope with changes of a limited magnitude. This problem is most naturally.</p>
