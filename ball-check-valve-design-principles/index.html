<p><strong>Ball Check Valve Design Principles</strong>, The interior surface of the main seats of ball check valves are more or less conically-tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow. Our quality high performance Tech-Taylor valve is a self-actuated two-way ball-check valve specifically designed for isolation of standby pumps. The ball valve uses a ball with a round through hole as the opening and closing part. The double piston effect seat design in the API 6D is also called the Double-Isolation-and-Bleed Valve DIB Valve.</p>

<p>In dynamic conditions flow The water pressure exceeds the spring tension. The full-ported valve seat is uniquely designed allowing the ball to seat leak-tight without getting wedge into the valve seat. Combination of SPE and DPE A trunnion mounted ball valve with the upstream seat unidirectional and the downstream seat bi-directional blocks the fluid at the downstream seat in both directions while it blocks the fluid on the upstream seat in one direction only. A Ball Check Valve consists of a threaded or flanged body with internal features that guide a rubbercoated ball in and out of the seat as the flow goes forward and reverse.

<p>Unlike other valves ball check valves use a spherical ball inside their bodies to help control the flow direction in pipes and systems. BALL CHECK VALVE The function of ball check valves is similar to the piston check but the ball check valves use a ball inside the body to control the movement of flow. The spring tension forces the plunger into its seat keeping the check valve closed. The Working Principle and Structural Characteristics of Ball Valve.

<p>The ball valve uses a ball with a round through hole as the opening and closing part. I used Algor to do the CFD and found it necessary to restrict the flow up to 60 GPM into the face of the ball or the flow speed and pressure at the ball face would cause the oil to burn.

<p>The double piston effect seat design in the API 6D is also called the Double-Isolation-and-Bleed Valve DIB Valve. Tech-Taylor valve features Rugged construction and proven abrasion-resistant. The spring tension forces the plunger into its seat keeping the check valve closed. In the closed position ball is pushed against the seat by the pressure of the fluid from upstream and hence can pressure seal the downstream of the valve.
