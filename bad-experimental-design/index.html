<p>Lack of a Randomized Controlled Trial The most reliable experiment to evaluate a medical treatment is a randomized controlled trial in which a population is randomly divided into a test group which receives the treatment and a control group which does not. This is a BAD sampling plan since the individuals in the convenience sample may systematically ﬀ from the population and therefore may not represent the entire population. Bad experiment design. This is appropriate because Experimental Design is fundamentally the same for all ﬁelds.</p>
