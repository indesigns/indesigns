<p><strong>Art Director Vs Senior Designer</strong>, Now in advertising theres typically two ways that one can learn to concept. Generally if a company has more than one Art Director one of these would become the senior art director. The biggest difference between an art director and a graphic designer is that the role of an art director is more supervisory while graphic designers focus on creating the actual product. Creative directors are the visionaries who maintain a holistic view of a project to ensure it meets the needs of the client.</p>

I am a multi-disciplinary designer based around Amsterdam. They may work with art directors on the overall concept but the art director works more as a supervisor rather than a designer.</p>

<p>The simple difference is that a graphic designer is focused on the execution and the art director is involved in the concept of the project.

While senior graphic designers lead their team of designers in projects art directors may be in charge of all designers as they take a broader look at work and consider the entirety of the visual design.
