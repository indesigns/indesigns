<p>During the life of a vehicle the alternator may be replaced with a non-OEM part. There are several types of batteries chemistry used in hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems but we are going to consider only Lithium-ion cells. The actual designs differ mainly in how the desired pack capacity and power is achieved. Typical protections required are overvoltage overload reverse polarity and jump start. The battery pack geometry structural design and position within the vehicle are all relevant design parameters when integrating the battery pack in the vehicle to ensure safety.</p>

<p>The fundamental piece of any electric vehicle EV is its battery. Automotive batteries are not designed as deep cycle batteries. It supplies the initial current to the starting and ignition systemsWhen the generatoralternator is not charging engine stopped the battery supplies the current to the other electrical devices for all the time. Our 3-D models show that half of the benchmarked models use grid and row layouts for the battery pack increasing the utilization of space and potentially lowering module-production costs.
