<p>As you may know generative design is part of the family of Design for Additive Manufacturing DfAM techniques. Given that additive manufacturing enables a new level of design freedom it makes sense to use it for complex models that require a more flexible manufacturing method. Strategies such as topology optimization and generative design have emerged as natural companions. Most generative design programs dont consider how the part will be manufactured so engineers must still use design for additive manufacturing DFAM principles to help create a better part that would reduce or eliminate the need for supports a process that requires a detailed understanding of the manufacturing process. Each brings out the best in the other.</p>
