<p>This method starts from the FRs defined by the users. The axiomatic theory includes two groups of axioms. Design problems are formulated and design solutions developed from abstract to detailed down hierarchies of abstraction and across functional physical and process domains during a zigzagging decomposition process so that the design solution is consistent with the axioms. Cost effective - Integrated - Intuitive -. It applies a scientific approach for designing products according to customer needs.</p>
