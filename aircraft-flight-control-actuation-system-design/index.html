<p>This consists of the development of ﬂexible parametric models of ﬂight control sur-faces being able to adapt to any wing geometry and their automatic integration in RAPID. Fly-by-wire actuators use signals from the pilot via the aircrafts flight control system to control flight control surfaces along the vertical pitch longitudinal roll and horizontal yaw axes for safe and coordinated flight. Actuators on aircraft perform a number of important functions such as adjusting flight control surfaces like the elevator rudder ailerons flaps slats and spoilers extending and retracting landing gear positioning engine inlet guide vanes and thrust reversers and opening and closing cargo or weapon bay doors.
