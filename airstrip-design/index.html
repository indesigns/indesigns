<p>Stripline Design Stripline transmission line requires three layers of conductors where the internal conductor is commonly called the hot conductor while the other two always connected at signal ground are called cold or ground conductors. Although there are design manuals covering the development of public airports information for developing limited use airstrips suitable for the small aircraft used on ranches and farms is not readily available. Our services address the infrastructure impacts clients face with increased passenger traffic and demands on airport facilities. Behind the scenes theres a fair amount of work goes on at the airfield and sometimes theres a need for someone to be here just in case - such as when aircraft and helicopters have to divert due to bad weather.
