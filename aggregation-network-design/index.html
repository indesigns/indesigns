<p>In common designs the aggregation layer is also the connection point for data center firewalls and other services. We are using the term customer to refer to ship product to the locations so if we ship product to a firm with ten customers we are talking about the ten locations. The aggregation layer design is critical to the stability and scalability of the overall data center architecture. Access and Aggregation networks are facing relentless pressure to cost effectively expand capacity to meet the ever-rising bandwidth demands from end users.</p>

<p>The aggregation layer design is critical to the stability and scalability of the overall data center architecture. The layering is mainly based on the principle of internal and external partial flow and the data center network is divided into a standard three-layer structure of core layer aggregation layer and access layer. Route aggregation is an alternate term for route summarization which is a method used to minimize the number of routing tables required in an IP network. In common designs the aggregation layer is also the connection point for data center firewalls and other services.
