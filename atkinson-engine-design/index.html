Adventures with the Atkinson Differential Engine 112707 Page 4 of 6 best choice for piston material but thats what I have. The Atkinson engine shown here was an extremely ingenious design which not only successfully evaded the stranglehold of the Otto patents but also promised increased efficiency because it could give greater expansion of the combustion gases.</p>

<p>The intake if used exhaust and ignition cams are located on the main crank shaft. This type of hybrid power train has two different and separate sources of power. Atkinson produced three different designs that had a short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The Otto-Atkinson Cycle Engine-Fuel Economy and Emissions Results and Hardware Design. Atkison engine achieves all 4 cycles inside one crankshaft revolution Priuss engine does not - as it is still Otto engine.</p>

<p>The engine was designed by James Atkinson in 1882 and like many of the internal combustion engines operating in a four stroke cycle it allows intake compression power and exhaust strokes. The 2015 Chevy Cruise also has a 18 liter engine though with an Otto cycle and it produces 138 horsepower 7667 horsepowerliter. How does a hybrid car engine work.

<p>Design The original Atkinson-cycle engine allows the intake compression power and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to bypass patents covering the existing Otto cycle engines. Avoid dust and dirt around the engine as much as possible. Its a clever solution where instead of the modern Atkinson style you have a traditional style Atkinson engine with a modern twist of allowing for variable compression ratio as well. The engine in the 2015 Prius which is an Atkinson cycle engine produces 98 horsepower from a 18 Liter engine 544 horsepowerliter.

<p>Atkinson produced three different designs that had a short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The intake if used exhaust and ignition cams are located on the main crank shaft. The Otto-Atkinson cycle engine operates on the Otto cycle at full load for good power density and on the Atkinson cycle at part loads for reduced fuel consumption.
