<p>A two-factor factorial design is an experimental design in which data is collected for all possible combinations of the levels of the two factors of interest. One of the big advantages of factorial designs is that they allow researchers to look for interactions between independent variables. In this complete balanced design the 9 1 random vector Y Y 111 Y 121 Y 131 Y 211 Y 221 Y 231 Y 311 Y 321 Y 331. Such a design although both balanced and orthogonal would not be a recommended experimental design because it cannot provide an estimate of experimental error.

<p>The experimental design must be of the factorial type no nested or repeated-measures factors with no missing cells. A fractional factorial design uses a subset of a full factorial design so some of the main effects and 2-way interactions are confounded and cannot be separated from the effects of other higher-order interactions. The generic names for factors in a factorial design are A B C etc. Such an experiment allows the investigator to study the effect of each factor on the.

<p>Full factorial experiments can require many runs. If in a balanced factorial design the variance for estimates of normalized contrasts is the same for all interactions of the same order the design is completely balanced Shah 1958 1960a.
