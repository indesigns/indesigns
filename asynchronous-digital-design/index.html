<p>ASYNCHRONOUS DESIGN CONCEPT The basic idea behind asynchronous design is that a digital circuit is asynchronous when no clock is used to implement sequencing. In a Synchronous Sequential Circuit all the State Variables representing the internal state of the circuit change their state simulteneously with a given input clock signal to achieve the next state. UpDown counter is the combination of both the counters in which we can perform up or down counting by changing the Mode control input. Asynchronous design is a rich area of research with many different approaches to circuit design. Asynchronous Learning Concept Icon Line Illustration Photoshop Design Learning.</p>
